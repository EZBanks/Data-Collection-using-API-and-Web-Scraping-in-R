# Data-Collection-using-API-and-Web-Scraping-in-R

This data collection project consists of two mini-projects using API and Web Scraping in R.

In the first mini-project, I use API technique to collect job-based data from Job postings portals and stored in IBM cloud in order to identify trends on emerging programming languages and database skills.

In the second mini-project, I use Web Scraping technique to collect Amazon 30 desktop best sellers.
